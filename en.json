      "title": "On the heights of Meyras",
      "p1": "Perched at over 370 meters above sea level, the castle of Ventadour proudly overlooks the valleys of the Ardèche and the Fontaulière.",
      "p2": "This strategic position, at the heart of a rugged landscape, once allowed it to control access routes between the Rhône valley and the Massif Central plateaus.",
      "p3": "It was not just a residence: it was a true stronghold, built to monitor, defend, and establish seigneurial authority over the surrounding lands.",
      "p4": "From its ramparts, one can take in a vast panorama that speaks volumes about its defensive role in the Middle Ages.",
      "p5": "Long forgotten, this castle witnessed centuries of power, conflict, and land transmission, before falling into oblivion… and then being reborn through an extraordinary human adventure.",
      "p6": "Today, the castle’s silhouette still marks the landscape of Meyras, a living link between past and present."
    },
    "intro2": {
      "title": "After 57 years of volunteering",
      "p1": "The modern history of the castle of Ventadour cannot be told without mentioning the hard work of the volunteers who, since 1969, have brought its ruins back to life, stone by stone.",
      "p2": "At a time when the site was nothing but a pile of stones overgrown with vegetation, Pierre Pottier, a teacher and heritage enthusiast, had the bold vision of a rebuilt castle.",
      "p3": "He then joined forces with the REMPART Union, a national network of youth volunteer workcamps, to launch a unique adventure. Each summer, dozens of young people from all over France – and sometimes from abroad – take part in this revival, guided by craftsmen, stonecutters, and historians.",
      "p4": "Their work goes beyond masonry: they learn to read the remains, understand ancient gestures, and live collectively around a common project.",
      "p5": "In nearly six decades, more than 7,000 volunteers have contributed to the restoration, making possible what once seemed unachievable.",

    "section1": {
      "title": "A story that continues to be written<br>9 centuries later",
      "p1": "Founded in the 12th century, the Ventadour Castle is part of the great feudal history of the Vivarais region.",
      "p2": "Originally a simple watchtower, it gradually evolved into a true fortress, enriched by the successive families who inhabited it.",
      "p3": "Its structure transformed from a Romanesque square keep into a complex ensemble of walls, towers, ceremonial halls, dovecotes, and advanced defensive systems.",
      "p4": "Like many other castles, Ventadour suffered the ravages of time: religious wars, the French Revolution, and abandonment.",
      "p5": "By the 17th century, it was already in ruins. In the 19th, it became a romantic ruin, a relic of the past. Yet nine centuries after its birth, the castle is experiencing a new golden age.",
      "p6": "Thanks to restorations, guided tours, and educational workcamps, the site now welcomes the public. The story is still being written — not just in books, but in the very stones of the castle, raised once again by modern hands with deep respect for the past."
    },
    "section2": {
      "title": "The dedication of Mr. and Mrs. Pottier",
      "p1": "When Pierre and Françoise Pottier discovered the ruins of Ventadour in the late 1960s, they didn’t see an end — they saw a beginning.",
      "p2": "At the time, the castle was nothing more than a pile of stones overrun by brambles, forgotten by all. But this passionate couple, with no wealth or institutional backing, firmly believed this heritage deserved to be saved.",
      "p3": "Pierre, a teacher and man of action, launched the first restoration projects in partnership with the REMPART Union. Françoise, equally dedicated, handled the logistics: funding applications, group coordination, historical documentation, and daily management.",
      "p4": "Together, they formed a complementary duo with unwavering determination. For nearly 50 years, they devoted their lives to this project. Their dream was not just to rebuild walls, but to restore meaning, history, and emotion to a forgotten place.",
      "p5": "Even today, their efforts remain a model of courage, civic engagement, and cultural transmission."
    },
    "section3": {
      "title": "From the Middle Ages to today",
      "p1": "Ventadour Castle has spanned the ages, passing through the hands of several noble families. In the 12th century, it belonged to the powerful Solignac family, then passed by marriage to the Montlaur, and finally to the Lévis in the 13th century.",
      "p2": "It was the Lévis who truly shaped the castle as we know it today, adding new enclosures, a noble hall, and architectural innovations ahead of their time.",
      "p3": "In 1472, the marriage of Jean de Lévis to Blanche de Ventadour gave the castle its final name. The seigneury remained prosperous until the 17th century, when decline began, especially after the Marcieu family abandoned the site.",
      "p4": "After the Revolution, the castle was sold as national property and used as a quarry. Nearly two centuries would pass before its rebirth, made possible by Pierre Pottier’s purchase in 1968.",
      "p5": "Today, its long history lives on in every cut stone and every rebuilt wall — a dialogue between medieval memory and modern vitality."
    },
    "section4": {
      "title": "Volunteers and scouts in action",
      "p1": "Every summer, Ventadour Castle becomes a vast, living worksite where volunteers, scouts, artisans, and heritage enthusiasts come together.",
      "p2": "Organized around specific missions — masonry, stone cutting, cleaning, reinforcement — these camps are also places of transmission.",
      "p3": "Guided by professionals, young participants learn medieval building techniques while discovering community life, physical effort, and the value of a shared project. These camps welcome everyone: students, adults in career transition, families, and associations.",
      "p4": "The results are spectacular: parts of the castle, such as the ramparts and wooden hoardings, have been entirely rebuilt thanks to this collective effort.",
      "p5": "Beyond the work itself, these camps are moments of human connection — evening gatherings, intercultural encounters — that give the place a unique soul.",
      "p6": "Perhaps it is in this collective momentum that the castle’s greatest victory lies: becoming a living place once more."
